# departure-times

Show live departure information for North and South Station (MBTA only).

This app was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Some CSS in `src/DepartureDisplay.css` was leveraged from the [*React: Up and Running* accompanying files repository](https://github.com/stoyan/reactbook). The `papaparse` module comes from http://papaparse.com/. All other code was either initially part of the create-react-app bootstrap or entirely written by Joel Sullivan.
